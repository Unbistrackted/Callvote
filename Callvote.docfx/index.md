### What is Callvote?

Callvote is a **Vote** plugin and framework for SCP:SL, written with usability in mind.

Callvote main purpose is to bring **Democracy🦅**to SL, so Players and Plugin Developers have an easy time creating votes for everyone to participate or ~~rig the system~~.

If you want to learn how to develop or use the plugin, please continue to [Installation](xref:install).<br><br>

### History of Callvote

Callvote dates all the way back to the start of 2019, with it first implementation in ServerMod2 then gradually making it's way to EXILED, NWAPI and now LabAPI.

The main reason for this Rewrite is to give Callvote a new look for Players and make it easier for projects to depend on it.<br><br>

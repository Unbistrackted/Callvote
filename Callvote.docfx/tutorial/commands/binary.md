# Binary Votings
How to call and customize your <span style="color:#00FF1D">**Yes**</span> or <span style="color:#FF0000">**No**</span> ``Voting`` using Commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remove the square brackets when using the command, they only serve as separation in this example.

### How to call

```
callvote binary [Question]
```

> [!WARNING]
> This Voting requires the ``cv.callvotecustom`` permission.

The ``Question`` can have as many arguments as you want, and the ``Voting`` has only two Options: <span style="color:#00FF1D">**Yes**</span> and <span style="color:#FF0000">**No**</span>.

The ``Options`` and ``Details`` for the ``Binary Voting`` are based and can be changed on the Translation file.

So by using this example:

```
callvote binary <color=#D681DE>question</color>
```
